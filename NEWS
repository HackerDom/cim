Version 2.10

* Once more: Hopefully corrected install bug for cygwin32.

Version 2.9

* Corrected bug in procedure Poisson

* Hopefully corrected install bug for cygwin32.

Version 2.7

* Included stdio.h in navn.c so that it will compile with gcc under
  sparc-sun-sunos4.1.3_U1

* Correctet a tiny bug in cimcomp.c

Version 2.6

* Added this file to the distribution.

* Updated README with compilation instructions

* Modified the Makefile in the lib directory so that it should be
portable across different make-implementations.

* Concerning exec'ing the shl-script: Setting arg0 equal the name of
the shl-script and prepend the shl-name with ./ so that the correct
script will be started. This is necessary to get it to work under
cygwin32.

Version 2.5

* Install the cim-library in $(libdir) instead of $(pkglibdir)
so that the correct library will be found.

Version 2.4

* simset.c, simset.h, simset.atr, simulation.c, simulation.h, and
simulation.atr will not be deleted by make (dist)clean. simset.shl,
simulation.shl, simset.mif, and simulation.mif will be deleted by the
clean target.

* Added a newline at the end of the generated C-code so that some
C-compilers will not complain.

* Removed some unnecessary code in the beginning of the generated code
so that some C-compilers would not complain about unreachable code.

Version 2.3

* make (dist)clean will not delete the library of atr-files.
Will only be deleted for the target maintainer-clean.

* cim --version now return 0 instead of 1.

Version 2.2

* Introduced 8 byte alignment, so that it should work under most modern
architectures

* The generated C-file include references to line-numbers in the
original Simula-file, so that a C-debugger will get references back to
the Simula-source file instead of the C-file.

Version 2.1

* A few bug-fixes that remained from 1.93

* The compiler-driver have been rewritten, so that the C-compiler and
the linker is started from a script that is exec'd so that the
resources that is allocated by Cim is freed before these parts are
started.

* The implementation of simula-libraries have changed. .o and .atr
files are now always located in separate ar-archives. The archive of .atr
files is included in the distribution so that it also would work on
systems that is not able to build this archive.

* A few options to the compiler have changes, and new ones have been
introduced. Se the documentation for details.

* Makefile.in's are generated by automake-1.12.

* Both static and shared libraries are now supported by use of
libtool-1.0.

* Djgpp, VMS and some older unix-variants are not longer supported
correctly. We suggest that you use GNU-WIN32/CYGWIN32 instead (URL:
http://www.cygnus.com/misc/gnu-win32/).

* For external modules a human-readable file which gives the signature
of the module is generated (.mif). This file can be used for documentation.

* New syntax for specification of parameters have been introduced.
This syntax is not documented, except in parser.y. The new syntax 
is used in the .mif-file. Try to compile an external module.

Version 1.93
 
* Changes not recorded.
